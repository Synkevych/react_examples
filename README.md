### props 
- Imutable!
- In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component.
- Props should never be changed in a child component, so if thereâ€™s something going on that alters some variable, that variable should belong to the component state.

- Props are also used to allow child components to access methods defined in the parent component. This is a good way to centralize managing the state in the parent component, and avoid children to have the need to have their own state.

The parent can pass a prop by using this syntax:
```jsx 
	<ChildComponent color=green />
```

### state

- State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.
- The state can be initialized by props.
- State is always passed from a parent down to a child component as a prop.
- State should not be passed to a sibling or a parent.
- State should be owned by 1 component. 
- Don't duplicate props to state.

### props.children
A collection of the children inside of a component ... 

```jsx
class Row extends React.Component {
	render() {
		<div style ={{
			display: 'flex',
			flexDirection: 'row',
			justyfyContent: 'space-around',
		}}>
		{this.props.children} // has element p, div, h1 
		</div> 
	}
}

class App extends React.Component {
	render(){
		return(
			<Row>
				<p>First Element </p>
				<div>Second Element </div>
				<h1>React</h1>
			</Row>
		)
	}
}
```
### setState
The correct way to change state in your application.
All changes to this.state should be pure.
```jsx
	this.state = {color: 'red'};

	this.setState({ color: 'blue'});
```

### Pure Function 
- A function with no side effects.
- It does not modify its inputs
- It's repearable (same inputs, same outputs )

```javascript
function doubleVals(arr){
	return arr.map(v => v * 2 ); //not change arr
}

let person = {id: 1, name: "Roman"};
function addJob(presonObj, job){
	return Object.assign( {}, personObj, {job});
//  return {...personObj, job};
}
addJob(person, "Student");
```

### Stateless Functional Components 
- Components implemented using a function not a class
- The funciton implements the render method only: no constructor, no state;

```jsx 
import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const Greeting = props => ( <h1> Hello, {props.name} </h1>);
export default Greeting;

Greeting.propTypes = {
	name: PropTypes.string
}
```
